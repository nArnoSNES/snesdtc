	6-4   Not used
	3-0   CPU 5A22 Version Number (version 2 exists)
	The NMI flag gets set at begin of Vblank (this happens even if NMIs are disabled). The flag gets reset automatically 
	at end of Vblank, and gets also reset after reading from this register.
	The SNES has only one NMI source (vblank), and the NMI flag is automatically reset (on vblank end), so there's 
	normally no need to read/acknowledge the flag, except one special case: If one does disable and re-enable NMIs, 
	then an old NMI may be executed again; acknowledging avoids that effect.
	The CPU includes another internal NMI flag, which gets set when "[4200h].7 AND [4210h].7" changes from 0-to-1, and 
	gets cleared when the NMI gets executed (which should happen around after the next opcode) (if a DMA transfer is 
	in progress, then it is somewhere after the DMA, in that case the NMI can get executed outside of the Vblank 
	period, ie. at a time when [4210h].7 is no longer set).

  7     H/V-Count Timer IRQ Flag (0=None, 1=Interrupt Request)
  6-0   Not used

The IRQ flag is automatically reset after reading from this register (except when reading at the very time when the IRQ condition is true (which lasts for 4-8 master cycles), then the CPU receives bit7=1, but register bit7 isn't cleared). The flag is also automatically cleared when disabling IRQs (by setting 4200h.Bit5-4 to zero).
Unlike NMI handlers, IRQ handlers MUST acknowledge IRQs, otherwise the IRQ gets executed again (ie. immediately after the RTI opcode).
